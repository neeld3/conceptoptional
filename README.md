Yolo Camera Detection
Currently, flask, cv2, numpy, picamera2, threading, queue, and twilio.rest are the libraries used. Must also have python installed.

Navigate to the project directory from the base directory via "cd project/" and enter the command "source env/bin/activate" to activate the virtual env with the necessary libraries. 
Once the virtual env is activated, navicate to the cat-detection library using "cd cat-detection/" and then run the detect.py file with "python detect.py" to start the script.

From here the local host is exposed with a tunnel to the domain conceptoptional and the camera feed is available at conceptoptional.com.

PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED.
